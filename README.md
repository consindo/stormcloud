Stormcloud
==========

An awesome weather app.

- Design and Dev by @consindo
- Icons (Climacons) by @AdamWhitcroft
- Weather by Yahoo
- Inspiration from @d0od, @sil and @GeorgeCzabania

Released under the DBAD License (Don't be a dick license).

Packages available exclusively from the Ubuntu Software Center.

Can't afford it?
----------------

It's $2.99, just think twice if you're currently sitting in Starbucks with your Mac, iPhone and $5 Latte.

In any case, it's pretty simple to get Stormcloud up and running.

- Download this repo
- Download node-webkit
- Drag and drop the repo onto node-webkit or `/path/to/nw /path/to/stormcloud` in terminal

I'm an unemployed high school student. Even though it's the most downloaded app in the Ubuntu Store, I'm not cruising in my luxury yacht.
